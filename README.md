# FilterButton


A fast way to manually trigger filters in thunderbird.

Allows to add a button to the message header view toolbar that shows filters that match the selected message, including manual and disabled filters. A click on the button allows to select a filter to run. If there is no filter that matches the current message, a click on the button allows to create a new manual filter.

Perfect for:

    Moving messages manually to folders that are preselected automatically
    Deleting spam messages on click or moving them to a specific folder
    ...
